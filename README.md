### OBJECTIVE
Build 5 shrines to win the game.  Shines have no other purpose.

### COLLECTING RESOURCES
There are two different ways to collect resources.  Farms and taxes.

FARMS - Use %build farm to build a farm.  Farms take 10 minutes to build.  The resources each farm produce are random.  If you are not happy with the amount of resources a farm collects use %destroy farm 1 to destroy your first farm then build another.  You can have up to 5 farms.  All farms can be built at the same time.

### TAXES
Taxes are collected from the citizens of your realm.  The higher your population and tax rate the more taxes you will get.

### POPULATION
Everyone starts the game with 100 population.  If your happiness is above 50% then your population will grow.  If it falls below 50% then population goes down.  Reputation can also increase your population.

### HAPPINESS
Taxes, reputation and how long ago you lost an attack all affect happiness.  Happiness goes up if your taxes are low.  32.5% tax rate is about 50% happiness.  A reputation below 50% makes happiness go down.  If you attack someone and lose then happiness will go down for 4.0 hours.

### REPUTATION
Reputation goes down if you attack a realm much smaller than yours.  Reputation slowly increases back to 50%.  Attacking someone and winning increases your reputation.  If you recently won an attack then your reputation can go higher than 50% which makes your population increase.

### ATTACKING
Hire soldiers with %hire 5 footmen.  Soldiers consume resources every 10 minutes.  Soldiers are hired from your population.  Attack another realm with %attack Danimal 5 footmen.  If your army defeats the other realm then they will steal 10% of their resources.  If you lose an attack it wil negatively affect happiness for 4 hours.  If you attack someone who is building a shrine with at least one catapult and win then the shrine will be destroyed.

### OTHER INFO
The game updates every 10 minutes.
