## todo

- allow short soldier names
- hire max
- notification when someone builds their 5th shrine
- build farms - build all farms
- bug: says winner built 4 shrines


## ideas

fortifications - anyone can put up fortifications at any time.  When fortifications are up everything in your realm pauses.  Only exception is attacking armies still attack.  Your realm goes to sleep.  You can take them down anytime.



## done

- raiding increases population.  reputation is normally at 50% instead of 100%.  and above 50% makes population grow faster.  and reputation goes up if you successfully attack
- make cats faster
- increase rate that population goes down from negative happiness
- show how many troops starved
- a way to destroy other people's shrines.  catapults?  while building?  shrines have hitpoints?
- fire soldiers
- bug: fix market exploit
- record winner of game in db.  show with %winners
- hiring takes away from population
- reputation.  stop people from attacking small realms.  lowers happiness
- fill out %help
- if you attack and lose then happiness goes down.
- population, happiness and taxes.  another source of income
- shrines
- mongo indexes
- send DM when someone attacks you
- cancel attack
- bug: %realm message is too long if you send lots of armies
- limit number of amries per player
- bug: loser always says lost all soldiers?
- allow uppercase soldier names when hiring
- show incoming armies
- icon
